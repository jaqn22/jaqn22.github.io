      <h1>Internet and Website Development</h1>
      <h2>1. Introduction to the World Wide Web (WWW)</h2>
      <h3>a) Explain how the web works</h3>
      <p>The client is a system which sends a request to the server to process and send a response back to the client. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed on the user’s browser.</p>
      <h3>b) Explain the role of web servers</h3>
      <p>A web server can be a hardware or software or both of them which work together. Hardware web servers is a computer that stores web server software and a website’s component files (e.g. HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheet and JavaScript file). It supports physical data interchange with other devices that are connected to the web. The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients.</p>
      <h3>c) What are web browsers?</h3>
      <p>Web browsers are software programs that allow you to access web pages on a device.</p>
      <h2>2. How is the world wide web different to the internet?</h2>
      <p>The Internet is a global network of billions of electronic devices. It allows you to access information and communicate with others around the world. While the World Wide Web (www) is a collection of different websites that you can access through the internet.</p>
      <h2>3. What is an intranet? How does it relate to the internet</h2>
      <p>An intranet is a local or restricted communications network that is used to share information within a company. An intranet is similar to the internet, however, is more privatised to people within an organisation. They both are a computer network which allows users to communicate and access information.</p>
      <h2>4. What is an internet protocol? Compare HHTP, TCP/IP and FTP</h2>
      <p>The Internet Protocol (IP) is the method of which data sent from one computer to another on the internet. HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a type of internet protocol which happens when a client sends an HTTP request to the web and once the request is received and processed, the server sends an HTTP response to the browser. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) allows two computers to communicate by dividing any message into a series of packets that are sent from a source to the destination. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) allows users to transfer files from one machine to another.</p>
